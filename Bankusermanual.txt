1. initialize_bank Function:
Purpose: Initializes the bank by creating an ObjectCore representing the bank's ownership.
Steps:
Create an ObjectCore instance with the owner set to the bank's address.
Mint the initial corpus to the bank. The actual token minting logic is a placeholder and should be implemented based on the token standard used.


2. apply_for_loan Function:
Purpose: Allows a customer to apply for a loan.
Parameters:
amount: The loan amount requested.
duration: The duration of the loan in seconds.
Steps:
Get the sender's address (borrower) using get_sender().
Check that the loan amount is greater than 0 and the duration is within specified limits.
Calculate the interest rate inversely proportional to the duration.
Create a Loan instance with borrower, amount, interest rate, duration, and initial values for remaining amount, installment amount, penalty rate, prepayment fee rate, last payment timestamp, and status.
Transfer the loan amount to the borrower. The actual token transfer logic is a placeholder and should be implemented based on the token standard used.


3. calculate_installment Function:
Purpose: Calculates the installment amount for a loan.
Parameters:
amount: The loan amount.
interest_rate: The interest rate for the loan.
duration: The duration of the loan in seconds.
Steps:
Calculate the total interest based on the loan amount, interest rate, and duration.
Calculate the total payment (amount + total interest).
Divide the total payment by the loan duration to get the installment amount.
Return the calculated installment amount.


4. make_payment Function:
Purpose: Handles loan installment payments.
Parameters:
loan: A mutable reference to the loan being paid.
payment_amount: The amount being paid as an installment.
Steps:
Get the current timestamp.
Ensure that the payment is not made before the last payment timestamp and that the payment amount is sufficient.
Calculate the outstanding amount considering interest accrued since the last payment.
If the payment amount is greater than the outstanding amount, handle prepayment and charge a fee.
Calculate the remaining principal after deducting the payment amount.
If the remaining principal is 0, mark the loan as fully paid; otherwise, check for late payment and apply a penalty if applicable.
Update the loan details including the remaining amount and the last payment timestamp.
